A sql database that is interacted with via Node js.

Please see the  [readme.pdf](https://github.com/Trodrigs1120/Node-SqlStoreFront-Inventory/blob/master/Readme.pdf)

The script accesses a sql database to act as an inventory for a business's supplies or a stores inventory. 

Once the script has been run you are able to order items from a list that is pulled from the sql database's tables. You can select an item via its item id number, 1-10 in this case. If the item has sufficient stock it will place the order, show the price calculating for the order total and allow the user to exit or order again.
